GithubSearch POC -

1) Unit test cases - 
    Covered unit test cases for service logic only(SearchService.swift). Textfield validation in depth covered in UI test case.

2) UI  test cases -    
    In the Simulator, please make sure I/O -> Keyboard -> Connect hardware keyboard is off. Otherwise most of the test cases will fail.
    This is a workaround for inputting text in the simulator.

3) Deployment target - 
    I have se up  target to iOS 11 and applied checks so that app can run on iOS 11 devices also, but due to machine related issue not  able to test app on  iOS 11     simulators. Please consider it.
    
4)  Third Party Library - 
    I want to use "SDWebImage" library for caching images but due to machine issue not able to use cocoapod. So i have not used any third party library.
